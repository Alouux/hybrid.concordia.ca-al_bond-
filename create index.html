                     <p>Given the freedom of time travel and the mission to change the internet, I would rather not partake in the cascading effect of a time ripple. That, and the natural progression of the internet has brought a lot of controversial influence to this world. The originally funding for this historical project came from the military, and had a massive impact on the speed at which the internet grew. If history were left in my hands, I would take the chance to hope on twitch in present day, 2023, and ask for donations to fund my very real trip to the change the past.  Maybe the future and past of the internet could write itself, through those donations. Who’s to say how much different it would be.

                  <p>Protecting user data and setting up proper boundaries for each particular user would be fundamental task, alongside setting up a service grid so there is an even distribution of services despite where you might live. When I lived up in the Laurentides, deep in Wentworth-Nord, we had no cell reception or wifi access for the longest time. Needless to say, I didn’t get much studying done unless I was at a library. So much of our day to day takes place online, people in and out of the computational field alike. </p>
